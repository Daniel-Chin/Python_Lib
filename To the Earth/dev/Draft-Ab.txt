ai can attack, escape, hunt, trap. 
Player 根据AI行为自己判断
#Player 也可以 隐藏自己等待AI进入trap然后strike
#No. you should encourage progressive gameplay
#太复杂！放弃tracking hiding trapping.

hiding is easier than tracking. 
AI of the same lv ship is weaker than player.

energy: easy to come by. 

there should be no one-off usable item. 
Only techs.
