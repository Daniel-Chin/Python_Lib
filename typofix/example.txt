I am just typing random words without liijubg at nt screeb, 
U hyst realized that ibce you remember how the fixer worls, upi can type in an appropriate fashion to cater to it. 
How mn=any ripos have I made> I do not know. This is just a test to see if my code has any buf in it. 

Now just testing if comma is accidentally a letterm hopinf thar went we;;. 

What if I swtich two letters? 

What if I dwruch two letters and did some horizontal typos?
