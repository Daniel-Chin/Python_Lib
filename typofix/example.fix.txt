I am just typing random words without looking at my screen, 
I just realized that once you remember how the fixer works, you can type in an appropriate fashion to cater to it. 
How many rupia have I made> I do not know. This is just a test to see if my code has any bug in it. 

Now just testing if comma is accidentally a letter, hoping that went well. 

What if I switch two letters? 

What if I switch two letters and did some horizontal typos?
