# How to run
**To run anything here, you need to add this repo to your `%PYTHONPATH%`!**  
*Otherwise nothing will work!*

A lot of the scripts include tests and demos.  
You can find them after `if __name__ == '__main__':` or in file `__main__.py`.  

# This repo is...
All the wheels I re-invented. 

# Wait, what?
This repo has various useful python tools and utils...  
and some projects that don't deserve a full repo.  

If you have questions or suggestions, please open an issue.  
(My repo doesn't have an issue yet... I figure it would be cool to have one...)
