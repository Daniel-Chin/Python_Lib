Press R to restart any time!!! 

You can even use R to skip the intro animation!!!

For Windows:
Install.py installs dependencies. 

For Mac:
Mac_Install.py sttemps to install dependencies on Mac. 
But it's not guaranteed to work. 
If it doesn't, I'm afraid Windows is the only opntion. 
Mac_Launcher.py launches the game.
